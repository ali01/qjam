qjam is a framework for parallel computation.

It leverages ssh public key setups to automatically bootstrap and start worker
nodes without manual intervention.


DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------

The following packages are required to use qjam:

  * Python paramiko (sudo aptitude install python-paramiko)
  * Python Nose (sudo aptitude install python-nose)
  * Python numpy (sudo aptitude install python-numpy)


EXAMPLES
--------------------------------

You need to have passwordless ssh access to localhost as your current
username. If `ssh localhost' at a terminal gets you to a new prompt, you're
golden. If not, set up ssh keys and/or an ssh agent as
appropriate. Alternatively, you can run the following examples on machines that
you can login to with ssh keys. However, paramiko, the ssh library that qjam
uses, does not currently support GSSAPI (kerberos logins).

  bin/sum-matrix-example.py
    This is a simple example that explains how to use the qjam API to execute
    code across many machines.


TESTS
--------------------------------

The tests for qjam are located in the 'tests' directory. To run the test suite,
type:

  nosetests

in the root directory. The tests are a good way to learn more about the
architecture of qjam.
